# Tamagotchi REDUX
Hello! Here in this web application that I have made you can relive the glory days of Tamagotchi's run through the toy market but with a more modern twist! The goal of this version of the game is to gain as much street cred as you can without letting your pet die. Good luck and have fun.

This intense survival game features:

 - Module interactivity (I.E. Stats interact with one another creating a need for strategy to maximize street cred gained)
 - Score tracking with the street cred.
 - Secure variables through the use of private variables so the user cannot use dev console to cheat.
 - Ability to add any image you like to use as your pets image that displays on screen.
 - A secret death screen should you allow your pet to perish.
